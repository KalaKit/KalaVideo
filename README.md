KalaVideo is a lightweight C++ 20 video editor/video player for Windows and Linux that is used for primarily trimming videos but also might have additional effect updates in the future. KalaVideo also has built in input support and includes KalaCrashHandler for handy crash reports. All the code is completely OS-agnostic so the exact same code works on both Windows and Linux.

External libraries included in this library:

- ImGui - UI for KalaVideo
- ffmpeg - video and audio edit and export
- MiniAudio - audio playback
